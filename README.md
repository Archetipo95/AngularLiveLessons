# AngularLiveLessons
This is the source code to accompany the "Learning Angular LiveLessons". It
covers Angular versions .  If you are looking for the source to accompany
"Learning AngularJS LiveLessons", please see the repo "LearningAngularJS".

Some notes:

* Lessons 4 and 5 are relatively simple, so I've just folded the code for those into Lesson 7
* For Lesson 8, I've created two folders for the different types of forms (see the Lesson)

If there are any bugs or problems with this source, please file a bug or--even
better--a pull request, and I'll get to it as soon as I can.

Thanks for watching, I reall appreicate. Please feel free to send me feedback. I'd like to know how I can make these better!
